Day 3: Interfaces & Smart Validators (The "Show Me The Money" Update) 💸

Today I was working with: interface implementation, function signatures, and manual logic fixing.

Day summary:

What I did: Finally taught my code that "positive number" doesn't mean "rich person." Now the system actually checks my Pay against the Price instead of just nodding like a distracted waiter.

Honest status: It works, but my code is now judging my bank balance. It’s no longer saying "Very good" twice like a broken parrot, because I finally deleted that redundant call.

Main enemy: My own copy-paste skills. Trying to feed a float64 to a function expecting an Order struct is like trying to pay for dinner with a picture of a dollar bill. The compiler was not amused.

P.S: Debugging tip: If your code tells you "Very good" while you're technically broke, you haven't built a validator — you've built a hype-man.
